This project was an excercise in building a CRUD application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

[Try it out!](https://nss-vocabyoulary.netlify.app/)

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is someone with time to kill playing around adding vocabulary to essentially a glossary of terms

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
When a user logs in, they are greated with a list of all vocabulary they have submitted (user dependent).
Filter buttons allow for quickly sorting on a specific code language
The Create Entry link takes the user to a form where they can add new entries into the list by providing a Title (term), Definition, and associated language.
Each card also gives the user the option to edit/update or delete that particular card.
